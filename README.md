### 🔮 Something Never Seen Before: `🌀 The Dream Pulse`

> Every time someone visits this README, a new *dream pulse* is generated — a randomly crafted vision of a future Miko might create:

```js
const dreamPulse = () => {
  const visions = [
    "An AI-driven cattle marketplace that predicts buyer behavior.",
    "A cross-continent ride-sharing app where users pay with solar credits.",
    "A decentralized social network where posts evolve like living cells.",
    "An app that writes your biography based on your browser history.",
    "A wearable that translates dreams into Git commits."
  ];
  return visions[Math.floor(Math.random() * visions.length)];
};

console.log("🌌 New Pulse:", dreamPulse());

def daily_ritual():
    dream = "wake up with a startup idea 💡"
    code = "ship 3 features before coffee ☕"
    learn = "read 2 docs + 1 GitHub issue 📚"
    repeat = "sleep like a rockstar, dream like a rebel 🌠"
    return f"{dream} → {code} → {learn} → {repeat}"

print(daily_ritual())
