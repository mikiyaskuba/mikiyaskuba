# 🧙‍♂️ Miko Kuba – Dream Hacker from the Horn of Africa

> “To become a billionaire, solve a billion problems.” – Miko Kuba

Yo! I’m **Miko Kuba**, a cosmic fusion of code, culture, and *crazy ideas that work*.  
I don’t follow trends — I **create worlds**. I’m here to turn local stories into global revolutions using code, courage, and pure chaos.

🌍 From Ethiopia to the multiverse, I’m building technology that doesn’t just function — it **feels**.

## 🧠 What I’m Building (A.K.A. My Madness)

🟡 **Kercha App** – Not your average meat delivery. A whole *culture system*, digitized. 8 people. 1 cow. Slaughtered live. Delivered fresh. RFID + Livestream included.

🔵 **JIVA** – An AI + blockchain-powered skill bartering marketplace. No money needed. Just talent, trust, and tech.

💖 **Poetic Love App** – A mobile diary of passion. Code meets poetry. A love letter in Android Studio.

🦂 **Venom Empire** – Starting a scorpion venom business in Ethiopia. Why? Because no one else is crazy enough to try.

💸 **Forex Hustle** – Turning $100 into $30,000. Just me, a dream, and the foreign exchange jungle.

🧪 **Energetic Fertilizer Project** – Solving Ethiopia’s farming challenges by engineering new bio-based fertilizers at my university lab.

🚕 **Mela Smart Taxi** – EV-based group taxi system for Addis Ababa. More seats, fewer emissions, powered by code.
