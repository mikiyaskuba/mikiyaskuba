# 🚀 Miko Kuba – Code Alchemist & Dream Hacker 👾

> “To become a billionaire, solve a billion problems.” – Me (obviously)

🌌 **Hi, I’m Miko** – born in the code, forged by dreams, raised by oxen and pixels.  
🧬 I don’t just *write* code – I **summon it from the ether** to solve the unsolvable.  
🌍 From the heart of Ethiopia, I launch ideas like rockets – ox-splitting apps, AI barters, poetic love machines, and more.

## 🔮 Current Mission: Build the Impossible

👁 Building **Kercha** – not just an app, it’s a *tradition reborn*.  
🧠 Designing **JIVA** – AI-powered skill barter that outsmarts capitalism.  
⚡ Cooking up a **poetic app** – to melt hearts and rewrite romance.  
🦂 Plotting my **scorpion venom empire** (yes, you read that right).  
💸 Trading Forex like it’s a video game from the year 3000.

💘 Love Letter to the Universe:
I’m not here to join the tech world.
I’m here to bend it to my vision – to make apps that bleed culture, dance with AI, and whisper poetry to your soul.
I don’t just code...
I prophesy in JavaScript.
